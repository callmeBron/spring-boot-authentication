# spring-boot-authentication
A repo dedicated to exploring and adding different types of authentication with Spring boot!

**Why do we need to secure an application** 

> Imagine you have an application with customers and their transactions. We wouldn't allow anyone who is not authorised to access this information, which means we need to implement a security layer to protect the data.
>

_Currently covered in this repo:_
  - Basic Authentication

_To be covered in this repo:_
  - JWT Authentication

**How to run this repo**

- Basic Authentication:
>Run the application 'BasicAuthentication', in the console you'll receive a generated password ('as this is just for example/practice purposes this is totally fine').
Use this to login on the login page at the endpoint 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users' the username will be the default 'user' name.
